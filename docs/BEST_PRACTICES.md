# Best Practices

- Always use version control: Make use of Git for version control to track and manage changes to your code over time.
- Code review: All code should be peer reviewed before it is merged into the main branch.
- Continuous integration: Incorporate a system of building and testing each time code is pushed to the repository.
- Ensure separation of concerns: Each component of the architecture should have a specific task. This improves debugging, testing, and understanding of the code.
- Follow the DRY principle: Avoid code repetition by making use of functions and classes to encapsulate repeated logic.
- Have a proper naming convention: Naming should be clear, concise and accurately reflect what the code component does.
- Secure your secrets: Never commit secrets like API keys or passwords in the code. Use environment variables or services like AWS Secret Manager.
- Document your code: Always document your code and provide a robust README so that other developers can quickly understand and start contributing.
