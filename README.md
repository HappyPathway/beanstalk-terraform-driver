# Beanstalk Terraform Driver Project

## Project Overview
The Beanstalk Terraform Driver is a comprehensive platform for managing, configuring, and executing Terraform deployments through a web-based interface. It combines AWS Elastic Beanstalk for hosting, CodeBuild for execution, and a Django UI to provide an end-to-end solution for infrastructure as code operations.

## Architecture Components

### 1. Django Terraform UI Application
A web-based user interface built with Django that allows users to:
- Select and configure Terraform modules
- Preview plans before execution
- Approve/reject changes through a workflow
- Monitor real-time execution status
- Explore Terraform state and resources

### 2. AWS Elastic Beanstalk Application Module
Terraform module that provisions and configures AWS Elastic Beanstalk to:
- Host the Django Terraform UI application
- Support Docker deployment
- Configure auto-scaling and load balancing
- Set up proper security and networking
- Provide connectivity to other AWS services

### 3. AWS CodeBuild Pipeline Module
Terraform module that sets up CodeBuild projects for:
- Running Terraform plan operations
- Executing Terraform apply operations
- Reporting status back to the UI
- Managing Terraform state
- Supporting various Terraform versions and modules

### 4. AWS IAM Permissions Module
Terraform module for managing security and access control:
- Creating least-privilege IAM roles and policies
- Supporting dynamic permission sets based on infrastructure needs
- Enabling cross-account access when necessary
- Implementing security best practices

### 5. Terraform Operations API Service
Intermediary service that:
- Facilitates communication between UI and AWS services
- Provides RESTful endpoints for Terraform operations
- Handles authentication and authorization
- Enables real-time monitoring of operations
- Manages Terraform state

## Integration Flow
1. Users interact with the Django UI to configure Terraform deployments
2. The UI communicates with the Terraform Operations API
3. The API triggers appropriate CodeBuild jobs for plan or apply operations
4. CodeBuild executes Terraform with proper IAM permissions
5. Results and status are reported back to the user through the UI

## Technical Stack
- AWS Services: Elastic Beanstalk, CodeBuild, IAM, S3, EventBridge
- Infrastructure as Code: Terraform
- Frontend: Django, Bootstrap
- Containerization: Docker
- API: RESTful with WebSocket support for real-time updates
